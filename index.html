                        Chinese history is one of the most difficult World History branches, because of our nation's size.

                        China was first governed by the <strong>Xia Dynasty</strong> even though there is no definitive proof of their existance. The first dynasty that we have actual proof of its existence its the <strong>Shang Dynasty</strong>, which ruled China until they were overthrown by the <strong>Zhou</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        The <strong>Zhou Dynasty</strong> ruled China while their power slowly started to fade. The Zhou government finally broke down into seven states, which are know as the <strong>Warring States</strong>. Years of wars followed this events until one of the states defeated the other six.
                        <br><br>
                        This state was the one governed by the <strong>Qin Dynasty</strong>. Its ruler, <strong>Shi Huang Di</strong>, proclaimed himself Emperor of China, giving birth to the <strong>Chinese Empire</strong>.

                        The <strong>Qin Dynasty</strong> didn't ruled for long though. It crumbled down some years after Shi Huang Di. After the Qin fall, the <strong>Han Dynasty</strong> took the power from Qin. During the Han government, China became one of the world's top economies (~ 206bC - 220aD).
                        <br><br>
                        The Han Dynasty eventually falled, leading to several more dynasties, until the <strong>Republic of China</strong> was instaured at the 1st day of January of 1912, with Sun Yat-sen, leader of the <strong>Kuomintang Party</strong> as president.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1927 the president Chiang kai-shek (from the Kuomintang Party) launched a military campaign to defeat local warlords and unify China under his control. After this events, the <strong>Communist Party of China</strong> decided to seize control over the Kuomintang leading to nearly 22 years of Civil War.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1949, the Communist Party of China took control of mainland China, and gave birth to the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>, while the Kuomintang leaders and members flew to the Island of <strong>Taiwan</strong>, to create the <strong>Republic of China</strong>.
