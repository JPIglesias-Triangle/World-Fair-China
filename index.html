                        Chinese history is one of the most difficult World History branches, because of our nation's size.
                        <br><br>
                        China was first governed by the <strong>Xia Dynasty</strong> even though there is no definitive proof of their existance. The first dynasty that we have actual proof of its existence its the <strong>Shang Dynasty</strong>, which ruled China until they were overthrown by the <strong>Zhou</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        The <strong>Zhou Dynasty</strong> ruled China while their power slowly started to fade. The Zhou government finally broke down into seven states, which are know as the <strong>Warring States</strong>. Years of wars followed this events until one of the states defeated the other six.
                        <br><br>
                        This state was the one governed by the <strong>Qin Dynasty</strong>. Its ruler, <strong>Shi Huang Di</strong>, proclaimed himself Emperor of China, giving birth to the <strong>Chinese Empire</strong>.

                        The <strong>Qin Dynasty</strong> didn't ruled for long though. It crumbled down some years after Shi Huang Di. After the Qin fall, the <strong>Han Dynasty</strong> took the power from Qin. During the Han government, China became one of the world's top economies (~ 206bC - 220aD).
                        <br><br>
                        The Han Dynasty eventually falled, leading to several more dynasties, until the <strong>Republic of China</strong> was instaured at the 1st day of January of 1912, with Sun Yat-sen, leader of the <strong>Kuomintang Party</strong> as president.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1927 the president Chiang kai-shek (from the Kuomintang Party) launched a military campaign to defeat local warlords and unify China under his control. After this events, the <strong>Communist Party of China</strong> decided to seize control over the Kuomintang leading to nearly 22 years of Civil War.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1949, the Communist Party of China took control of mainland China (led by <strong>Mao Zeodong</strong>, and gave birth to the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>, while the Kuomintang leaders and members flew to the Island of <strong>Taiwan</strong>, to create the <strong>Republic of China</strong>.

                            During 1966 a cultural movement called the <strong>Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution</strong> (also known as Cultural Revolution) was promoted by the chairman of the Communist Party of China, <strong>Mao Zeodong</strong>, who wanted to preserve the "real" <strong>communist</strong> ideology among China.
                            <br><br>
                            Mao insisted that <strong>capitalist</strong> idea were being spread among chinese borders, so Mao started a purge to eliminate the last remmants of capitalist and traditional chinese ideas.

                            To eliminate this capitalist/traditional idea, Mao displaced a huge chunk of China's population, he ordered raids to cultural and religious sites, and he ordered the destruction of historical relics. During this time, Mao also ordered executions to non-loyal chinese citizens.

                            Most of China's population is concentrated on the <strong>eastern coast</strong> (seen on the image aside), because historically there has been easier access to water in that region.

                            The <strong>Himalayas</strong> and the <strong>Kakakorum</strong> are mountain ranges that separate China from the rest of Asia. The tallest mountain (without counting Mt. Everest and other mountains from the Himalayas and Kakakorum, because they are shared with other countries) is <strong>Kongur Tagh</strong>, with a height of 7649m.

                            The <strong>Great Wall of China</strong> is a name given to a series of fortifications, that were generally built east-west (horizontal in realtion of the Ecuator) to protect China from the Mongols and other nomadic invaders.
                            <br><br>
                            The Great Wall was started thanks to the order of <strong>Shi Huang Di</strong> (Qin Dynasty, First Emperor of China). This wall didn't last for long.
                            <br><br>
                            The Wall that you can see today was mainly built during the <strong>MIng Dynasty</strong> (~ 1368 to 1644). It was also used for border controls on the <strong>Silk Road</strong>.
